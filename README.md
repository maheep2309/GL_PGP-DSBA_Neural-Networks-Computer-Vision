This project builds a deep-learning–based helmet detection system for workplace safety. It preprocesses images, evaluates multiple ANN/CNN/VGG16 models, and selects the best classifier to identify workers with or without helmets, improving real-time safety compliance and reducing manual monitoring errors.
